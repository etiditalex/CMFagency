# Google Business Profile Setup – Knowledge Panel & Search Visibility

This guide helps you get a **Google Knowledge Panel** for Changer Fusions when users search for your business—similar to the rich result shown for companies like Eujim Solutions (with business name, rating, location "in Ambalal", images, map, and action buttons).

## Why This Matters

The Knowledge Panel appears on the right side of Google search results when someone searches for your business name. It shows:
- Business name and category (e.g., **Marketing agency in Ambalal**)
- Star rating and reviews
- Location and map
- Photos
- Action buttons: Website, Directions, Reviews, Call, Save, Share

**This panel is controlled by Google Business Profile (GBP), not by your website alone.** Your website structured data supports it, but you must claim and complete your profile.

## Step 1: Create or Claim Your Google Business Profile

1. Go to [business.google.com](https://business.google.com)
2. Sign in with your business Google account
3. Click **Add your business to Google** (or **Manage now** if you already have a profile)
4. Enter **Changer Fusions** as the business name

---

## Step 2: Set Your Business Category

1. When prompted for **Business category**, search and select:
   - **Marketing agency** (primary)
   - Or: **Advertising agency**, **Marketing consultant**, **Event management company**
2. This will appear as **"Marketing agency in Ambalal"** (or similar) in the Knowledge Panel.

## Step 3: Set Your Location to Ambalal

1. When asked **Add location**, choose **Yes, I serve customers at my business address**
2. Enter your address **exactly** as:
   ```
   Ambalal Building
   Nkruma Road
   Ambalal, Mombasa
   Kenya
   ```
3. Use the map pin to place your business at the correct spot (Ambalal Building, Nkruma Road)
4. The locality **Ambalal** will help Google show “Marketing agency in Ambalal” in the panel

## Step 4: Add Contact and Website

1. **Phone:** +254 797 777347
2. **Website:** https://cmfagency.co.ke
3. **Email:** info@cmfagency.co.ke (if prompted)

## Step 5: Verify Your Business

1. Google will ask you to verify ownership (postcard, phone, or email)
2. Follow the verification steps—this is required for the profile to go live
3. Verification can take a few days

---

## Step 6: Complete Your Profile (Important for Rankings)

- **Business hours:** Set your opening hours (e.g., Mon–Fri 9:00–17:00)
- **Description:** Use keywords like “marketing agency in Ambalal”, “digital marketing Kenya”, “event management Mombasa”
- **Services:** Add your main services (digital marketing, web development, branding, events, market research)
- **Photos:** Upload high-quality photos of your office, team, and work
- **Products/Services:** List your key offerings with brief descriptions

---

## Step 7: Encourage Reviews

- The Knowledge Panel shows your rating and review count
- Ask satisfied clients to leave reviews on your Google Business Profile
- Respond to reviews to build trust and engagement

---

## What Your Website Already Provides

Your website has been updated with:

- **Structured data (JSON-LD):** LocalBusiness and Organization schema with address locality set to **Ambalal**
- **Keywords:** “Marketing agency Ambalal”, “Changer Fusions Ambalal”
- **Consistent NAP:** Name, address (“Ambalal Building, Nkruma Road, Ambalal, Mombasa”), and phone across the site

This supports Google’s understanding of your business and location, and helps the Knowledge Panel display correctly once your Google Business Profile is verified and complete.
